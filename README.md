# ResumeRefine

ResumeRefine is a free online tool that provides AI powered resume analysis. The tool prompts the user for a email and PDF file (representing the resume) and then sends an email with a link for the analysis results. The resume analysis consists of an overall feedback of the resume and three lists containing strengths, weaknesses and suggestions. 

The project is available at https://resume-refine.com
